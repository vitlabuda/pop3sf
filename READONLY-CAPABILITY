* The read-only mailbox access mode POP3 protocol extension *
*************************************************************



1.  Introduction

    The POP3SF's implementation of the POP3 protocol offers a non-standard extension - read-only mailbox access mode.
    In Section 4, RFC 1939 [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1939#section-4] specifies the following:

       Once the POP3 server has determined through the use of any
       authentication command that the client should be given access to the
       appropriate maildrop, the POP3 server then acquires an exclusive-
       access lock on the maildrop, as necessary to prevent messages from
       being modified or removed before the session enters the UPDATE state.
       If the lock is successfully acquired, the POP3 server responds with a
       positive status indicator. The POP3 session now enters the
       TRANSACTION state, with no messages marked as deleted.

    In other words, when a client has logged in and is connected, no other client can log in using the same username,
    because if more clients with read-write permissions were connected and were provided the same message set,
    they could delete the same messages, which could cause an inconsistency of the underlying data source.

    However, not all clients might want to connect to the server to delete messages - some clients might just want
    to check for new messages and optionally retrieve them. To address this, this server's implementation of the
    POP3 protocol offers a non-standard POP3 extension which allows a client implementing this non-standard extension
    to switch its session to the read-only mode.

    The following sections of this document describe the details of this extension.



2.  "X-POP3SF-READ-ONLY" capability

    CAPA tag:
       X-POP3SF-READ-ONLY

    Arguments with CAPA tag:
       none

    Added commands:
       XPRO

    Standard commands affected:
       DELE, RSET

    Announced states / possible differences:
       both / no

    Commands valid in states:
       AUTHORIZATION

    Specification reference:
       this document

    Discussion:
       The X-POP3SF-READ-ONLY capability indicates that the client can issue the XPRO command when in the
       AUTHORIZATION state to switch the session to read-only mailbox access mode.



3. "XPRO" command

    XPRO

    Arguments:
        none

    Restrictions:
        may only be given in the AUTHORIZATION state

    Discussion:
        The POP3 server switches the session to the read-only mailbox access mode.
        If all connected clients with the same username haven't the read-only mailbox access mode enabled, only one
        session can exist for a specific user at the same time.

        If the POP3 server issues a positive response (+OK), the standard DELE and RSET commands become unavailable
        after the client authenticates. These commands will always return a negative response and it won't be possible
        to delete messages from the mailbox. Such negative response will contain the X-POP3SF-READ-ONLY response code.

        If the read-only mailbox access mode isn't allowed on the server, the POP3 server issues a negative response
        (-ERR) containing the X-POP3SF-READ-ONLY response code.

    Possible Responses:
        +OK
        -ERR

    Examples:
        C: XPRO
        S: +OK Mailbox access mode switched to read-only
        ...
        C: DELE 1
        S: -ERR [X-POP3SF-READ-ONLY] The mailbox access mode is set to read-only
        C: RSET
        S: -ERR [X-POP3SF-READ-ONLY] The mailbox access mode is set to read-only

        C: XPRO
        S: -ERR [X-POP3SF-READ-ONLY] Read-only mailbox access mode is not allowed



4.  "X-POP3SF-READ-ONLY" response code

    Complete response code:
        X-POP3SF-READ-ONLY

    Valid for responses:
        -ERR

    Valid for commands:
        XPRO, DELE, RSET

    Response code meaning and expected client behavior:
        The "X-POP3SF-READ-ONLY" response code indicates that the failure is due to a problem with the read-only
        mailbox access mode.

        If contained within a response to the XPRO command, it indicates that the read-only mailbox access mode isn't
        allowed on the server.

        If contained within a response to the DELE or RSET command, it indicates that the client attempted to delete or
        undelete messages from the mailbox when the session is in the read-only mailbox access mode.
