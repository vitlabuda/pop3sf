    This adapter relays messages from a filesystem directory to the POP3 server.

    The valid username and bcrypt-hashed password is passed to the constructor, just as the path of the directory where the messages will be taken from.
    Message files with .eml extension will be relayed to the client without modification, whilst .txt files will be wrapped into an email's body; other files are ignored.

    An external program must not rename, move, delete or write to the message files!
    It can add them at any time, but it must do so atomically - it must lock the files using flock() while writing the message!
