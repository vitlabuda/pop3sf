    This adapter is similar to DirectoryAdapter, but it offers multi-user capabilities.

    Instead of passing the username and bcrypt-hashed password to the constructor, the credentials are loaded from a file in a per-user directory.
    The directory, whose path is passed to the constructor, contains directories whose names are used as usernames.
     The folder name (username) must match this regular expression: ^[0-9A-Za-z_-]{1,64}$
    Each of these directories contains a file named ".pop3sf_password_bcrypt" that contains a bcrypt-hashed password for the user and the messages themselves.
    Message files with .eml extension will be relayed to the client without modification, whilst .txt files will be wrapped into an email's body; other files are ignored.

    An external program must not rename, move, delete or write to the message files!
    It can add them at any time, but it must do so atomically - it must lock the files using flock() while writing the message!
