class AdapterBase(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):
    """
    The AdapterBase class is a abstract base class for adapters - classes that relay email messages from some external data source to the POP3 server.
    By extending this class, one specifies the methods of accessing and providing email messages to the POP3 server.

    The program gets an instance of an adapter by calling the Settings.get_adapter() method.
    This method is called for every newly connected client. It MUST return a new instance of an adapter of every time it is called.

    Some methods of this class accept an "index" integer argument. This argument refers to a specific message provided by the adapter.
    The index is always between 0 and get_message_count() - 1 and, except when passed to the is_message_marked_as_deleted() method,
     it's never the index of a message that was marked as deleted.

    All methods of this class are thread-safe - if the server is executing an adapter's method, no other adapter's method is executing at the same time.

    If all connected clients with the same username haven't the read-only mailbox access mode enabled, only one session can exist for a specific user at the same time.
    This prevents multiple concurrent sessions from deleting the same message which could cause inconsistency of the underlying adapter's data source.
    This "uniqueness" of standard (read-write) sessions is checked after the verify_login_credentials() method call,
     so the login_successful() method isn't called if this check fails.

    Every method of this class (including __init__) can safely raise the AdapterCloseConnectionException exception;
    in such case, the client connection will be closed immediately and the client thread will be terminated.
    It should be noted that if it's raised in a method other than connection_closed(), the connection_closed() method will be called.
